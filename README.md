# rust-tcp
A simple library for doing TCP in Rust

So there I was...learning to Rust. Along the way I needed to do some TCP-foo. Rather than do tedious stuff over and over again I decided to make this. I don't expect it to be Robust or even useful to too many people. I created it as a learning exercise.
